# 01 — Foundry Project + Model Deployment

## Goal
Create an Azure AI Foundry project and deploy a model so later steps (agent hosting, tracing, grounding, and governance) are real.

## You will end with
- A Foundry project
- A model deployment you can call from the agent (Responses API)

## Prerequisites
- Completed `../00-environment-setup`

## Proof (checklist)
- [ ] Foundry project exists and opens in the portal
- [ ] Model deployment exists and is callable
- [ ] You have recorded the deployment name for later steps

## Next
Continue to `../02-application-insights-tracing`.
